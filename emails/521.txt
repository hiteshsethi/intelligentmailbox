*Some Helpful Information : *
*
*

   - Try to make your bot in modules so that it is not damaged in
   transportation.
   - Carry small tools with you (eg. Hand saws, Soldering Irons, etc.) in
   case you need to make last minute repairs.
   - Your bot must fit within a 30 cm X 30 cm X 30 cm box at its initial
   starting position. After the start, your bot may extend to bigger
   dimensions. If you are using multiple bots,   ensure that they all together
   fit within the dimension box. They must be placed in the arena in the same
   configuration.
   - Try to pack light since you will be spending most of your time in the
   arena itself.
   - The *Robot Repair Consultancy Centre (R2C2)* will have people to help
   you in case you have technical queries. Be sure to approach us in case of
   any troubles.
   - If there is a *Robotix Student Executive at your college *or nearby,
   you can always interact with him/her for more details on the event.
