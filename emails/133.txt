Getting started on Google+
Find people you knowCircles are the heart of Google+ - they control who you  
share with and whose posts you see.  Find people you know, then drag and  
drop them into circles that match your real-world relationships.

visit your stream to see what they're saying. When you find something you  
like, add a comment or click +1 to just say "cool!"

can include photos, videos, and links. Select the circles or people you  
want to share with, or choose "Public" so that anyone can see what you have  
to say.
