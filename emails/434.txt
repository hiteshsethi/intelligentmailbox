Hi,



Greetings to all. Techkriti, the Annual Technical and Entrepreneurship
Festival of IIT-Kanpur brings to you its first green competition, GREEN
MEDIA.

Techkriti'12 lays just the perfect platform to showcase one's concern for
environment in out of the box style and reach maximum people through its
online event Green Media.



The task is to unleash your inner genius. Awareness is empowering.  But a
common man is too naïve to understand the gravity of the situation in the
technical vocabulary. Hence, we bring to you the challenge to be able to
communicate to the masses through means that help them assimilate the
growing concern for the environment.



The competition requires you to use any medium like a video, website,
interactive software, game, comic strip, or campaign to convey
environmental issues to common people in simple and elegant ways.



To find details of the problem statement, visit:

So if you think that you can convey environmental issues to the masses,
then go to the link, grab the ideas that float through your brain and get
ready for the competition.



We are also organizing the following online events:

·         IOPC

·         Crypto Contest

·         Stocksim

·         Insight

·         Eduvate

·         J.K White AdMad
