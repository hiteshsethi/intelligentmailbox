To acclimatize you to the competition environment and to give you a steady practice ahead of the main event, we will run a series of team contests, every day starting from 1st December 2014 to 19th December 2014. The details for this series of contests are as under: Each contest will be a team contest, so multiple login sessions will not be allowed from one team login. The problems in these contests will be picked from among the existing problems of CodeChef. So, while the solutions will be available in public, we expect you to not look at them and solve them with your team with absolute honesty. The idea is to provide team practice. There will be only one contest page and you will have to register your team only once (no need to do it every day). A set of problems will be added every day and the old set will be removed. It will be a three hour contest starting from 21:00 hrs to 00:00 hrs IST everyday. You can register your team anytime during the entire duration. The contests will not have any impact on ratings. Now the details of the said series: Starting Date: Monday,1st December, 2014 End Date: Friday, 19th November, 2014 Contest Timings: Everyday, 18:00 HRS IST to 21:00 HRS IST Link: ACM-ICPC Practice round 2014. We hope this will help some of you to get the much needed team practice. We invite you all the greenhorns as well as the experienced campaigners preparing for the ACM ICPC Asia regionals to get your teams ready for the main event. In more exciting news from CodeChefâ€™s kitchen, we have opened our platform to the corporates as well. It means that the corporate organisations can now organize their contests with CodeChef for free. However, we still remain an educational initiative and shall not be making any money from this exercise, and neither will we be sharing any of our userâ€™s information with the organizers. More information on this new initiative of ours can be found on our blog below: CodeChef For Corporates. That is all from us here at CodeChef. We wish you all the very best for the contests ahead.

'Hostel issues 1. Year 2014 is ending with huge success for our students. We are touching 2100 offers to our 1400 eligible students across three campuses on date. SAP event was another highlight of the year. 2. Whilst we bid goodbye to year 2014 with a happy note, we are aware that a good number of students are yet to get placement. There are others who could have got better offers. Do not lose hope and keep preparing. If you so desire , meet me on any afternoon . 3. *For my 3rd years*: Meet your seniors who have succeeded in Deloitte, Amazon,SAP etc and also meet those who have not made it so far. Experience of these will help you find your path to success. â€˜*Wise people learn from others mistakesâ€™*. You canâ€™t succeed without preparation. It is just about time to start preparing for campus 2016 starting in Jul 2015. God willing, biggies (companies with higher salaries) will be the first to visit. Excellent performance in campus 2015 by our students was not good enough as 20+ vacancies (CTC>9lac) were lost due under performance. â€œDO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN AGAINâ€?. 4. If Modiâ€™s slogan â€˜make in India made in Indiaâ€™ succeeds, manufacturing sector will grow. This ought to create new vacancies in core companies. Until then we are dependent on our regular recruiters. 1. Recently I carried out a survey to map your career path and expectations. I have gone thru each one of your comments . Appreciate for putting down some of your genuine grievances and positive note. 2. I will make all efforts to mitigate your pain & discomfort. However , *anger & frustration* solves nothing â€“ it only makes you bitter and unacceptable by society. Share your frustration & anger with me. May be I canâ€™t solve all your problems but at least you would have let out your steam. There is no single solution for all , yet we try sincerely to see that each one of you is comfortable to the extent possible. *There is always room for improvement and therefore your suggestions are always valuable. * 1. It is very cold and freezing in higher floors. Only answer is extra woolens and blankets. Some of you have *lighted fire* in the balcony not realizing that it can cause fire in the building *endangering life of its occupants*. Similarly usage of electrical appliance can burn sockets not designed to take heavy loads and cause fire. *I am confident that you would not like to expose yourself and your fellow students to such dangers.* 1. *All students residing in a wing/ balcony will be held responsible and severely dealt with, if any ashes / burnt wood/ paper/lit fire etc are found close to your area. *You must SMS/phone your coordinator/warden or me immediately if your partner or neighbor indulges in wrongdoings*. *Your identify will be kept confidential. *Your safety is in your hands*. 1. We have many cases of thefts and therefore unauthorized personnel including day scholars are not permitted inside the hostel. Minimum fine of Rs. 2500/- will be imposed on both the guest(day scholar) and host(hosteller). 1. We wish you a very Happy New Year and hope you enjoy and celebrate the occasion with your family and friends. We too are your well wishers and will remain so forever . May God bless you . 1. Reach me out any time when you need help and* wish to help* ,at kk.rohatgi@jiit.ac.in &n sp; Your Dean -- If you no longer wish to receive mail from this sender, Please click here -- Hitesh Sethi Undergraduate(4th year)-B.tech JIIT,Noida Contact : +91-8586021769',INBOX
